        <h3>Models of Good Practice</h3>
        <p>I wanted to make a dark-themed website, but I wasn’t sure how modern websites approached making one so during my research I came across Awwards page on the 50 most beautifully designed websites (<a href="https://www.awwwards.com/50-beautifully-designed-black-websites.html">https://www.awwwards.com/50-beautifully-designed-black-websites.html</a>).  I noticed that the recurring theme was that they would only contain a few colours and big images or illustration on their landing page. Using these models and what I originally planned, I made my website the way it is now.</p>
        <p>At the start of the design process I looked at several dark-themed sites. From what I looked at, there would only be one or two dominant colours filling the page for example the screen shot below is of Tender to Art’s landing page (<a href="http://www.tendertoart.com/en/">http://www.tendertoart.com/en/</a>) , Artem Pivovarov’s landing page (<a href="http://artempivovarov.com/">http://artempivovarov.com/</a>) and Ever and Ever’s landing page (<a href="https://www.everandever.co/">https://www.everandever.co/</a>) . I liked how they used different shades of black to make up his site as well as the scrolling animations to scroll through the content without moving the page. As you scrolled down there were also big images and big text to fill the page.</p>
        <div class="ScreenshotOne">
            <img src="images/TenderToArtS1.png" alt="TenderToArt Screenshot 1">
        </div>
        <div class="ScreenshotOneMobi">
            <img src="images/TenderToArtS1Mobi.png" alt="TenderToArt Screenshot 1">
        </div>  
        <div class="ScreenshotTwo">
            <img src="images/ArtemPivovarovS1.png" alt="ArtemPivovarov Screenshot 1">
       </div>
       <div class="ScreenshotTwoMobi">
          <img src="images/ArtemPivovarovS1Mobi.png" alt="ArtemPivovarov Screenshot 1">
     </div>
       <div class="ScreenshotThree">
          <img src="images/EverAndEverS1.png" alt="EverAndEver Screenshot 1">
       </div>
       <div class="ScreenshotThreeMobi">
          <img src="images/EverAndEverS1Mobi.png" alt="EverAndEver Screenshot 1">
       </div>  
        <p>As I was only going to use Html and CSS mainly, I could not produce such a smooth scrolling experience therefore I produced two red block sections either side of any content I would put on any of my pages therefore simulating a long scroll experience. The reason that these sites could produce such one – coloured sites is because of their animations being able to take the blandness of the colour scheme away. As I was not going to have whole page animations such Tender to Art I would have to add more colour which is why the blocks on either side of each page is red and not black or a similar shade. </p>
        <p>For clarity all text is in white as it is the natural opposing colour to all the dark colours on my site. For the navigation bar, I opted for a drop-down menu as I felt it was natural since the site is being built upwards from a mobile perspective. I used big images on the landing page to fill the space as this was a feature I found common in a lot of sites I viewed. This would be because to capture the user’s attention, an image is effective than large areas of single colour.   </p>
        <p>As a team we grouped physically and talked about different designs and features we may include. We would ask each other what colour would suit certain parts of the site or if this feature was correct to be included in a section etc. I have recently just started using Slack which is a informal chat group program for our class and I noticed someone had asked if we needed to use PHP to make the contact form useable, but someone else answered saying he should just make the front-end of the form and then connect a 404 Not found page to the form’s submit button. This influenced my decision to also create a 404 page otherwise I might have not realised or bothered to do so.</p>
