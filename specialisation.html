        <h3>Specialisation: Software Engineering</h3>
        <p>Hi there, it’s Raj and I am going to talk about my own specialisation within the world of Computing that is being, Software Engineering. To start with what is Software engineering defined as, well from the Techopedia site, they define it as: </p>
        <!-- Definition comes from https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13296/software-engineering -->
        <p>“Software engineering is the process of analysing user needs and designing, constructing, and testing end user applications that will satisfy these needs through the use of software programming languages.” (Source:<a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13296/software-engineering">https://www.techopedia.com/definition/13296/software-engineering</a>).</p>
        <p>From this statement there are quite a few skills shining through such as:</p>
        <p>-	Analysis of user needs<br />
          -	Design skills<br />
          -	Necessary technical or construction skills<br /> 
          -	Maintenance and thorough testing skills<br />
          -	Knowledge of require programming languages<br />
          </p>
        <!--Information below is rephrased, summarised and comes from https://www.allaboutcareers.com/careers/job-profile/software-engineer -->
        <p>As such these skills covers most of the important skills when becoming a Software Engineer. </p>
        <p>Then we have to go on to what the job entails specifically, in other words, a day in the life of a Software engineer. The following video concisely describes what kind of work he does, the working environment and certain perks that come from working as a Software Engineer at wayfair.com.</p>

        <p>Now to go into the particulars such as salary, working hours, entry requirements and training. First off, salary for entry software engineers earn between £22,000 to £30,000 while seniors earn between £35,000 to £70,000. If you are a freelance contractor you may earn even more than the above, up to £450 per day sometimes. As for working hours, the average software engineer works normal office hours of 9 am to 5 pm, five days a week however you may have to work more to meet deadlines. To enter into this profession, you will have to at least have a undergraduate degree within the computer science field and it is recommended to have IT related work experience. For training, most will be done within the job itself as IT and Computer science is a ever evolving subject and self-study may be required, otherwise there are organisations that provide courses and qualifications to either refresh skills or learn new ones. </p>
