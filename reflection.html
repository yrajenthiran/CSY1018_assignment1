        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>My experience of learning web design and web development overall was a positive one. The classes weren’t in any way difficult or hard to understand as my lecturer would run through at a reasonable pace and would allow us a 10-min break in the middle of the two-hour session. I had not done any web development since I was 12 or 13 and even then, it was very basic, so this class was a new scope of computing to me. Having now gone through a term of learning web development I would say it has it’s positive and negative aspects.</p>
        <p>I like web development because when you are making a website, it is very easy to see the work your making in graphically unlike if I was working on software, I would not be able to see it graphically until I made a UI for it. I also like the aspect of web development having programming languages to provide layers over each other to make a wesbite work, such as the html is for the structure of the site while the CSS is the look and style of the site. However you can still make a website just using Html or even add JQuery or scripts to improve the site, it just depends on how far you are willing to work on a site.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the aspect of web development I don’t like is the lack of debugging techniques. When I work on a software it is easy to just make a simple test by adding bit more code and then the IDLE would print statements based on the process it’s going however you cannot do that with web development as the code that is recognised is displayed only as a site therefore if you have CSS it can be difficult at time to debug, for example, at a point I came across a problem where a section would be lower than it should have been. It turned put that because of an extra tag bracket it not only displayed on the site but the bracket was black on the site and the background was also black so I could not see it. Regardless I like web development.</p>
